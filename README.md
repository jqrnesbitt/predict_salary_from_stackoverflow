# Predicting Salary From Stack Overflow Survey Data

This repo is for the final project submission for W207. Here we attempt to predict salary data from Stackover Flow's annual survey. Within this report we do the following:

 - Extensive data cleaning since we're using a public dataset
 - EDA and feature engineering
 - Perform feature selection
 - Train/Test linear regression, random forest, SVC and logistic regression models through grid search and cross validation
 - Validate on unseen data and produce results
